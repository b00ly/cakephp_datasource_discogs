/* About */
This is a datasource for accessing the discogs.com API.
For more information and to get an API key go to http://www.discogs.com/help/api

/* Notes */
  * The datasource is a bit geared toward my particular application and will likely
  need some changes to generalize some of the methods.
  * I ended up dropping Discogs as a datasource, because I found the data somewhat
  unreliable.  Just a warning.
  
/* Instructions */
  * Sign up for an API key at the discogs site.
  * Configure the datasource in your /app/config/database.php file:
    var $music = array(
      'datasource' => 'discogs',
      'apiKey' => 'APIKEYHERE'
    );
